# Resume-to-job-matching-app
This is a machine learning-based Streamlit app that helps match uploaded resumes with job descriptions. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the content of resumes and compare them to specific job roles. The app then gives a match score, helping recruiters and job seekers quickly see how well a resume fits a job.
